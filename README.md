*DESCRIPTION* : Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using Scikit-learn to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled emails and evaluated based on its accuracy and classification metrics.

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset (spam.csv) containing email messages and their corresponding labels (Spam or Ham).
Perform text preprocessing:
Remove unnecessary characters and symbols.
Convert text to lowercase.
Tokenize words and apply TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction.

2. Model Implementation
Use Scikit-learn to implement a machine learning model:
Logistic Regression (or other models like Naïve Bayes, SVM, etc.).
Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
Train the model on preprocessed email data.

3. Model Evaluation
Assess model performance using:
Accuracy Score – Measures overall correctness.
Confusion Matrix – Shows the distribution of correct and incorrect predictions.
Precision, Recall, and F1-score – Evaluate how well the model distinguishes between spam and ham emails.

4. Results and Interpretation
The confusion matrix provides a breakdown of:
True Negatives (Ham correctly classified)
True Positives (Spam correctly classified)
False Negatives (Spam misclassified as Ham)
False Positives (Ham misclassified as Spam)
Classification Report summarizes precision, recall, and F1-score for both spam and ham emails.
